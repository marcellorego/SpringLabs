Below are commonly used Spring annotation which makes a bean auto-detectable:

@Repository - Used to mark a bean as DAO Component on persistence layer
@Service - Used to mark a bean as Service Component on business layer
@Controller - Used to mark a bean as Controller Component on Presentation layer
@Configuration - Used to mark a bean as Configuration Component.
@Component - General purpose annotation, can be used as a replacement for above annotations.
@RestController - Used to mark a bean as Rest Controller Component

Note that all above mentioned annotations are internally annotated with @Component, so indeed you can use @Component everywhere, but to keep the design & intention clean, itâ€™s advisable to use different annotation based on different condition.
